- WHY heap struct sizes also need to be aligned?
    - see the analysis of the implementation of `pvPortMalloc`
    - in general: to ensure the byte alignment of each allocated stack

> function-like macros

- simple text replacement during pre-processing time
- compared with the normal function definition
    - much more efficient as no function stack is going to be created, can save some CPU cycles
- disadvantage
    - readability can be a night-mare
    - impossible to debug this macro!
- modern in-line functions run as fast as function-like macros

- [x]  WHY defining an un-used variable `pxFirstFreeBlock`
    - `xStart` and `xEnd` are linked to each other via this variable
        - **WORKs** because the first few bytes in the heap are un-used (needed to ensure byte alignment)
            - `pucAlignedHeap` is casted to be `BlockLink_t` which is linked to the end
                - that’s to say, `xStart` → `pucAlignedHeap` → `xEnd`

- [ ]  when the data or function needs to be stored in the PRIVILEGED memory sections?

- overhead of `BlockLink_t` used to keep tracking the next available chunk of memory with specific size
    - start address of the heap is aligned
    - each allocated memory size is aligned
        - the above guarantees the dynamically allocated memory is always aligned!
            - explains why the size of the struct `BlockLink_t` also needs to be aligned

```

- `heapBITS_PER_BYTE` is only created to enhance the readability
    - after all each BYTE consists of 8 bits on all modern architectures
- MSB of `xBlockSize` indicates whether the current block of memory is free or already allocated
    - ATTENTION: it needs to be released, i.e. cleared when the memory block is freed
- `heapBLOCK_SIZE_IS_VALID` is used to ensure the MSB of `xBlockSize` is not set because of the too large size

- `if( heapBLOCK_IS_ALLOCATED( pxLink ) != 0 )` needed because the previous `configASSERT`
    - either not provided - empty macro
    - or not causing any runtime interrupt (exception) of the execution
- NOTE: `( void ) memset( puc + heapSTRUCT_SIZE, 0, pxLink->xBlockSize - heapSTRUCT_SIZE );`
    - ONLY data part should be cleared
    - `BlockLink_t` needs to be retained to keep recording the size of the current block
    

> `xFreeBytesRemaining` includes the size of the `heapSTRUCT_SIZE`
> 
- makes sense as `heapSTRUCT_SIZE`  is always considered as part of the memory block to be allocated
    - overall, the memory block to be allocated is **ALWAYS** larger than wanted size

- `for( pxIterator = &xStart; pxIterator->pxNextFreeBlock->xBlockSize < xBlockSize; pxIterator = pxIterator->pxNextFreeBlock )`
    - WHY there is no check of the `pxIterator->pxNextFreeBlock`, which can be `NULL` in theory?
        - use case
            - first allocated block consumes all the heap
                - guaranteed by the initialization `start.xBlockSize = 0`
            - first allocated block consumes less the heap
                - the remaining size is smaller than the wanted
                    - guaranteed by the initialization `start.xBlockSize = 0`
                        - the extra heap block is inserted to the free list
                    - when the allocated block is freed
                        - easy piece
                - the remaining size is larger than the wanted
                    - guaranteed by the initialization `start.xBlockSize = 0`
                        - the extra heap block is inserted to the free list
                    - when the allocated block is freed
                        - guaranteed by the initialization `start.xBlockSize = 0`
        - `xStart.xBlockSize` is never updated as it is used as a **sentinel** node which guarantees that the block to be inserted into the free list can ALWAYS get a position
            - this explains WHY there is no need to check `pxIterator->pxNextFreeBlock` to be none-NULL as it will never be
